# Robot_mobile-project

The aim was to create a small game in which a simulated mobile robotic platform (two wheels) provided with
of a 6-axis manipulator arm terminated by a gripper is used to navigate and then grasp a set
of 10 objects scattered in the environment, then bring them back one by one to a place where they
will need to be stored.

Project done with Unity and C#.

There is differents states : one to move the robot and another to move robot arm and pickup object. 

We use "arrow key of the keyboard" to move the robot and robot arm.

We can change the camera view with the keyboard button "Alt".

to pickup objects use keyboard button "left shift".
