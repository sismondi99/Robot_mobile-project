# Robot_mobile-project

The aim is to build a robot which can move inside a room and pickup objects and put them in a defined deposit area.

We use "arrow key of the keyboard" to move the robot

And there is differents states : one to move the robot and another to pickup object

We can change the camera view with the keyboard button "Alt"

to pickup objects use keyboard button "shift"
