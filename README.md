# Robot_mobile-project

The aim is to create a small game in which a simulated mobile robotic platform (two wheels) provided with
of a 6-axis manipulator arm terminated by a gripper is used to navigate and then grasp a set
of 10 objects scattered in the environment, then bring them back one by one to a place where they
will need to be stored.

We use "arrow key of the keyboard" to move the robot

And there is differents states : one to move the robot and another to pickup object

We can change the camera view with the keyboard button "Alt"

to pickup objects use keyboard button "shift"
